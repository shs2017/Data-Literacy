%Hennings explanation
%Put your abstract here. Mention, in two sentences, what you are planning to work on. 
%Then, mention which dataset you are planning to use. Include \href{https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02135/south/daily/data/}{a link} to the dataset you are planning to use (If you are planning to collect your own data, explain how you are going to do so). If possible, mention (one sentence) how you came across this dataset, or why you decided to do this. Explain what kind of analysis you are planning. Finally, declare which results your are expecting to achieve. Your entire abstract should be at most 20 lines long.
%We will use mostly this same template for the project report, potentially with some minor updates.


%In this study we will use data from the on-going Robust Mouse Rejuvination (RMR) study to predict the effects of multiple intervention on the lifespan of rats. The goal is to be able to predict how each intervention contributes to the lifespan and then be able to predict the combination of interventions that will lead to the longest increase in lifespan using current data before the study concludes. Data will be collected from parsing the graph data located at (https://www.levf.org/projects/robust-mouse-rejuvenation-study-1/study-updates/november-5th-2023) into raw data, then fitting statistical models to each factor in the study. We also plan to synthesis this with data from other studies into one larger dataset. \\
%The motivation for this study is that solving the problem of aging is one of the large open questions currently faced in biology, which has been shown to be potentially tractable in recent years by reversing the aging process rather than just slowing it down. The RMR study is one of the largest on-going studies in this area. By being able to predict which factors are most likely to lead to the largest increase in longevity one could predict to which combinations should be studied further.

% v2 Daniel
In this study, we will use data from the ongoing
Robust Mouse Rejuvenation (RMR) study to
predict the effects of multiple interventions on
the lifespan of rats. Our goal is to
predict how each intervention contributes to
the lifespan and the combination of interventions that will lead to
the most prolonged increase in lifespan. 
%We will use the latest data of RMR before their study concludes.
We plan to collect their data by contacting the contributors of this study or by parsing the graph data located \href{https://www.levf.org/projects/robust-mouse-rejuvenation-study-1/study-updates/november-5th-2023}{here}. And then we will fit statistical models to each treatment factor. In addition, we plan to synthesize this with data from other studies into one larger dataset.
Our motivation is that solving the aging problem is one of the large questions currently facing biology. 
%This goal has been shown to be potentially tractable in recent years by reversing the aging process rather than only slowing it down. 
%The RMR study is one extensive study in that area that started in January 2023 \cite{levf2023}. 
By predicting which factors are most likely to lead to the most significant increase in longevity, one could predict which combinations should be studied further.

%v3 Draft Eric - Some reorganizing and ideas for phrasing. I think its good to start the abstract with the motivation. Probably need to shorten either way.

% The nature of aging appears to be one of the most enigmatic questions in the field of biology. A recent ongoing investigation, the Robust Mouse Rejuvenation study (RMR) signifies a potentially significant stride in our understanding of aging. The research not only seems to decelerate the aging process in rats but, intriguingly, suggests a reversal \cite{levf2023}.
% In our project we want to use data from the RMR study to
% predict the effects of multiple interventions on
% the lifespan of rats. Our goal is to
% predict how each intervention influences lifespan and identify combinations that yield the most substantial longevity increase. By forecasting which factors are pivotal for a noteworthy increase in lifespan, we aim to pinpoint combinations worthy of further exploration.
% To achieve this, we intend to utilize the latest data from the RMR study, procuring it before the study concludes. Our approach involves obtaining the data by either reaching out to the contributors of the study or extracting it from the graph data available \href{https://www.levf.org/projects/robust-mouse-rejuvenation-study-1/study-updates/november-5th-2023}{here}. Additionally, we plan to amalgamate this information with data from other studies such as \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22587563/}{this}, creating a comprehensive dataset. Our methodology involves collecting raw data and subsequently applying statistical models tailored to analyze the specific characteristics of each treatment factor. This hopefully allows for a comprehensive understanding of the effects and intricacies associated with the interventions under consideration.

\section{Contribution Plan}

%Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member is going to contribute. For example, you could write: Max Mustermann is going to collect and prepare data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe will run the data analysis. Jane Doe is responsible for visualizations. All authors will jointly write the text of the report. Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.

%v2 Daniel
Daniel and Aline are responsible for collecting and synthesizing the available data. Then Jackson and Eric will do the preprocessing, data analysis, and model fitting. Jackson will work on the introduction and motivation summaries. Furthermore, Eric and Daniel will create visualizations and figures. Finally, Daniel and Aline will analyze the limitations and biases of our study.
